While repairing old arcade game boards I've came cross the need for test different types of RAM chips. Many of not so old chips can be tested with modern devices like the TL866II and other. However some very old chips like the HM2510 which is a single bit RAM are not supported. So I've written this quick scketch to check my 1 bit ram chips.
